Restacker
=========

This is a simple ESO add-ons to restack items in your bags

The aim of this plugin is to allow multiple stacks of the same item to be merged into a single stack after a trade has occured.

Other things that may be added once this works
* Button on the inventory to perform the auto-stacking
* Button to transfer all filtered items from bag to bank (or vice versa)
* Auto stack from bags to bank (or back again) : Others are already doing this, but fits with the overall theme of the add-on
